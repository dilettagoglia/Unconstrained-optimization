# Unconstrained optimization algorithms
**(Problem)** *is the problem of estimating the matrix norm <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=||A||_2">
for a (possibly rectangular) matrixÂ <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A \in R^{m \times n}">, using its definition as an (unconstrained) maximum problem.*

**(Alg1)** *is a standard gradient descent (steepest descent) approach.*

**(Alg2)** *is a a quasi-Newton method such as BFGS (one which does not require any approximations of the Hessian of the function)*
